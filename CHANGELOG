  * Major rewrite, many internal APIs changed, overall performance improvements
  * Added gigabit ethernet support
  * Added flexible internal routing (local streams) with simplified
    API, framework is much more powerful for many-channel applications 
  * Rewritten audio_clock_recovery as more flexible media_clock_server

  * Added uip IP/UDP/TCP server for adding configuration layer
  * Various bug fixes

31st July 2009
------------------
  * Dropped support for xs1a architecture
  * Major rewrite, many internal APIs changed, overall performance  improvements
  * New mii-ethernet layer (better performance, capable of 2-port switch)
  * New clock recovery mechanism (including global clock recovery)
  * Internal APIs now use XC features (desktop tools 9.7.0+)
  * New, more efficient, I2S codec interface code
  * XDK Demo is now both a talker and listener endpoint
  * XDK Demo now has debug log on screen (black button)
  * XDK Demo now has stream selection display (green button)
  * XDK Demo now has touch screen equalizer (16 bank bi-quad filter)
  * Demos (synthesised talker) for XC-2 and XC-3 dev boards
  * Added capability to have multiple talker endpoints on network
  * Some 802.1as bug fixes

30th April 2009
------------------
  * Added capability to have multiple talker endpoints on network
  * Some 802.1as bug fixes

6th April 2009
------------------
  * Added XC-2 mii code
  * Now default to xslb
  * Windows makefile issues fixed

14th February 2009
------------------
  * Code restructuring
  * Added dsp based clock recovery
  * Documentation updates

30th January 2009
-----------------
  * Various bug fixes
  * Major code restructuring
  * PTP now defaults to old multicast mac address (can be set to
    802.1as multicast with build flag)
  

15th January 2009
------------------

  * Various bug fixes.

  * 802.1AS support.

  * First spec of host side API for communicating to an XMOS device
    implementing AVB.
  

19th December 2008
------------------

  * Media clock recovery now fully based on 802.1AS
    timestamps. Presentation time is honoured.
  
  * Changed 1588v2 timing protocol to 802.1as (note that some issues
    remain - see release notes for details)

10th December 2008
------------------
 
  * Code now runs codec in slave mode on the listener and implements 
    media clock recovery.

  * Fixed timestamp to match spec. Timestamps are generated every 8
    samples (according to IEC61883-6 SYT_INTERVAL)  - so a valid 
    timestamp is generated every 3 out of 4 packets

  * Implemented internal bandwidth restriction in mac layer. Each 
    link going the mac layer (e.g. ptp, avb stream) 
    can be set to use no more than a certain number of Mbps of
    bandwidth (see the mac_set_bandwidth function). 

27th November 2008
------------------

  * Fixed bug in Mii ethernet layer that hung the demo when a short
    (<64 bytes) packet was received.


21st November 2008
------------------

  * General internal code restructuring to prepare for future
    enhancements
  * Fixed timestamp generation issues, AVB packets are now timestamped
    every packet (i.e. every 6 samples) corrected
  * Fixed incorrect DBC value creation
  * Tested on RevB silicon
